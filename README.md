## App Flow

### 1. Login
The login page includes three buttons for `EC`, `CC`, and `JC`. Users select their role, enter their password, and log in.

### 2. Allocating Budget
`ECs` can initiate a new event and assign a budget. This budget becomes available for `CCs` and `JCs` to use.

### 3. Submitting an Invoice
`CCs` and `JCs` can submit invoices by uploading a picture of the bill and entering the amount. The invoice will enter a pending state until verified by a `CC` or `EC`.

### 4. Verifying an Invoice
When a `CC` or `EC` verifies an invoice, the amount is deducted from the allocated budget.

### 5. Getting a Summary
`ECs` can generate a comprehensive summary of all expenses, including detailed statistics on spending by category and user.
